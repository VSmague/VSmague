2nd year student at [ENSAE Paris](https://www.ensae.fr/).

Data Science, Machine Learning and Economics enthusiast.

Here are some of my academic projects at ENSAE !

### Currently working on :

* Accident severity prediction using machine learning models in association with the [CREST](https://crest.science/). [Project](https://github.com/solinemignot/statapp_sujet26)

### Some Projects :

* Music genre prediction in Python using machine learning models (Random Forest, XGBosst) and Spotify's API. [Project](https://github.com/TurboClem/Python-pour-la-Data-Science)
* Delivery network optimization in Python using deterministic algorithms (Kruskal's Algorithm, Floyd-Warshall algorithm) and non deterministic algorithms (greedy algorithm). [Project](https://github.com/VSmague/ensae-prog23)
